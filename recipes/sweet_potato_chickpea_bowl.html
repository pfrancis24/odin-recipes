      <li>1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas (drained, rinsed + patted dry)</li>
      <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
      <li>3/4 tsp chili powder</li>
      <li>3/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp each salt + pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp tsp oregano (optional)</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp turmeric (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Tahini Sauce (optional)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup tahini</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp maple syrup</li>
      <li>1/2 medium lemon (juiced)</li>
      <li>2-4 Tbsp hot water (to thin)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and arrange sweet potatoes and
        onions on a bare baking sheet. Drizzle both with a bit of oil, making
        sure the flesh of the sweet potatoes are well coated and placed skin
        side down on the sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for another 8-10 minutes, then remove from oven and add kale.
        Drizzle kale with a touch more oil and season with a pinch each salt and
        pepper. Bake for another 4-5 minutes then set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        While vegetables are roasting, heat a large skillet over medium heat and
        add chickpeas to a mixing bowl and toss with seasonings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once hot, add 1 Tbsp oil (amount as original recipe is written // use
        half of total amount if altering batch size) and chickpeas and sauté,
        stirring frequently. If they’re browning too quickly, turn down heat. If
        there isn’t much browning going on, increase heat. I found 10 minutes
        total at slightly over medium heat was perfect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the chickpeas are browned and fragrant, remove from heat and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare sauce by adding tahini, maple syrup and lemon juice to a mixing
        bowl and whisking to combine. Add hot water until a pourable sauce is
        formed. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve: slice sweet potatoes into bite size pieces. Divide vegetables
        between 3 serving bowls and top with chickpeas + tahini sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep for a few days in the
        fridge.
      </li>
    </ol>
